    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts, cooked and shredded</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Rotel (or green chilies)</li>
        <li>Homemade Taco Seasoning (or half packet if using store bought)</li>
        <li>Cream of Chicken Soup</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese (any kind will do but we love Monterey jack cheese)</li>
        <li>Tortillas (corn tortillas or flour tortillas)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, brown the chopped onions until soft.</li>
        <li>Add in the shredded chicken, taco seasoning, Rotel, and half the can of cream of chicken soup.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium high heat until mixed thoroughly and heated through.</li>
        <li>Spoon the chicken mixture evenly into the tortillas. I heat the tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds to make them more pliable.</li>
        <li>Roll and place in a 9Ã—13 baking dish with the seam side down.</li>
        <li>Continue to do this until your pan is full.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix the remaining cream of chicken soup, sour cream and milk in a bowl until combined. If the sauce is too thick, add a small amount of chicken broth to thin the sauce out</li>
        <li>Pour mixture over your rolled tortillas. Sprinkle with the shredded cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes until heated through.</li>
    </ol>
